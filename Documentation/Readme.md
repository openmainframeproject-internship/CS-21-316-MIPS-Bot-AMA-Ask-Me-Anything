## Statement of Work
  The goal of the MIPS Bot AMA Project is to establish a chatbot that can assist developers and new programmers with learning about the IBM Mainframe. The bot, powered by IBM Watson Assistant, will use a combination of machine learning and crowdsourcing to develop nuanced, and easily readable answers to general system queries, and specific api questions. 
  The current model features simple intent driven dialogue, with information parsed from the zOS dictionary to supply answers. All relevant data and supplemental data is stored in a MongoDB instance.
